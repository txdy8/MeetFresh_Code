# Store-site-Recommendations-Using-Clustering-Metrics

The purpose of this project is to investigate the requirements of the existing and potential customers. According to these requirements, 
we will design a recommendation system to help Meet Fresh (a bubble tea brand) fascinate more customers by recommending where to open a new Meet Fresh store based 
on geographical data of each location in the US.

In this project, we used three techniques to analyze our dataset. The first algorithm is the k-means clustering. The second algorithm we adopted is the DBSCAN,
which is a density-based spatial clustering method. The last algorithm is the Alternating least square (ALS) algorithm.

The complete code can be found in utils folder.
